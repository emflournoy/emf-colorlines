            <p>I'm all about combining components in just the right way to create the perfect outcome. Websites, photographs, design, branding, language, feeling, aesthetic - it all comes togeter to really portray things in a profound and meaningful way. A website is more than something you look at. A photograph is more than just an image. Let's talk about how we can take your project beyond the eye.</p>
            <p>I'm a Boulder-based jack of all trades with a specific emphasis in Web Development backed up by experience in photography, graphic design, branding, marketing, business & event management, and so much more. I am currently enrolled in the Galvanize Boulder Full Stack program in addition to working outside of school as the Project Director for RiseUP The Movie.</p>

                <p>Collaboration goes so much deeper than just a person to work with. It's important to have a connection beyond simple compensation. Don't jump on a ship and sail out to sea with a crew you don't love... here's a bit more about the sailor.</p>
                <p>I grew up on a small horse farm in the Georgia countryside. I loved the sound of the rain on the tin roof of the barn my family lived in. I've had a passion for nature and animals since day one. Most of my childhood afternoons were spent exploring the farm forest with a troop of scraggly dogs as my sidekicks. My imagination led me on so many adventures, the numerous books I read could barely compete. I wore a Batman costume to kid every day and renacted Lion King regularly. </p>

              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>My sense of adventure has only continued to flourish since I was a kid. Education took me from Georgia to Montana for the Rocky Mountain School of Photography, then turned south for a Cum Laude honors degree in Photography and Graphic Design from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Between school, I've spent summers living on sail boats in the British Virgin Islands leading programs for marine science, turtle tagging, community service, sailing, and scuba to kids from around the world. </p>
                <p>Today I spend as much time outside as possible. Whether it is climbing, hiking, biking, swimming, sailing, snowboarding, ice climbing, horseback riding, or even just an afternoon of frisbee in the park... count me in. Though I've had so many different types of pets in my life, one shaggy mutt named Fawkes has stolen my heart these days. I love learning, simplicity, color, bold design, and truly believe that people are good.</p>
